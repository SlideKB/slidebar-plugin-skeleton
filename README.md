# slidebar-plugin-skeleton
Skeleton for SlideBar plugins

This is a skeleton dummy implementation for demonstration on how to implement your own standalone plugins.
Do not remove the AutoService annotation or your plugin will not be found at runtime!

To start developing your own plugin, rename the package, class and pom artifact to whatever you want to and start implementing the methods.

After you developed your plugin or want to test it, package it by running `mvn clean package` and put the resulting target jar file besides the main program.
